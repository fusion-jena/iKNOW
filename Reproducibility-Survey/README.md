This repository is dedicated to a survey about reproducible domain Knowledge Graphs.

## Survey Methodology
We have searched first for the keyword ''domain knowledge graph'' in the [Google Scholar search engine](https://scholar.google.de/) (accessed on 17.01.2022). We narrowed our search to papers published by the end of 2021.
We looked at their domain names, and we then extend our search for those specific domain names, e.g., for ''biodiversity knowledge graph'', ''biomedical knowledge graph'', and so on. We have deleted the duplicated entries of the "domain knowledge graph", if they appeared in other categories too. 

Among the papers listed in the search results, we have selected a subset of them by limiting these criteria: (i) we considered articles written only in English, (ii) we selected those papers, which focus on creating or building KGs. Note that some of these papers focus on the usage of KGs or other aspects. Thus, we exclude them. Moreover, the result obtained from google scholar shows the papers for our specific keywords, when the keywords exist in the title, introduction, or the state-of-the-art section. Some papers do not really focus on the topic of our keywords. They have brief sentences on that keyword e.g., in state of the art. So, they mainly were not about generating KGs, therefore, we did not consider them too.
