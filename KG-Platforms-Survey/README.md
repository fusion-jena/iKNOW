Leveraging Knowledge Graphs for iDiv and Biodiversity

This repository is dedicated to our research material for a survey on the Knowledge Graphs management platform.

Our research study is submitted to the [ESWC Wokrshop](https://2022.eswc-conferences.org/workshops-tutorials/).

## Survey Methodology
We used the systematic approach to finding publications on KG platforms: We have queried for the keyword ``Knowledge Graph Platform'' in the [Google Scholar search engine](https://scholar.google.com/) (access on 09.02.2022). At the time of querying, this resulted in 162 papers (including citation and patents). We used [Publish or Perish 8 tool](https://harzing.com/blog/2021/10/publish-or-perish-version-8) to save the result of the query.

Among the list of papers, we selected the relevant papers manually. We aimed to select papers that focus on the KG management platform.
Some papers appeared in the result of google scholar because our keyword exists in their texts (e.g., in the literature review section), but those papers mainly do not propose a new KG platform. 
We did not include such cases. Moreover, we did not consider survey papers and papers written in a language other than English.




## Results
In this repository, we publish the result of our query to Google Scholar in two different formats: [CSV](https://github.com/fusion-jena/iKNOW/blob/main/KG-Platforms-Survey/KGplatfrom.csv) and [bib](https://github.com/fusion-jena/iKNOW/blob/main/KG-Platforms-Survey/KGplatform.bib).

In the [KGplatfrom-Filtered.csv](https://github.com/fusion-jena/iKNOW/blob/main/KG-Platforms-Survey/KGplatfrom-Filtered.csv) file, we specified which papers have been selected, and for non-selected ones, we clarified the reason.
