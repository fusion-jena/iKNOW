Leveraging Knowledge Graphs for iDiv and Biodiversity

This repository is dedicated to our research in tool management in Knowledge Graph platforms. 
We propose a semantic feature-based recommendation system to help users find suitable tools for the Knowledge Graphs generation process.

## Parameters
We identified four important parameters to be considered:
- **Available tools in the platform**: A list of available tools in each step of KG creation along with their characteristics should be accessible for the matcher.
- **Dataset or intermediate result**: The matcher needs to know the characteristics of the initial dataset in the first step and the intermediate results in other steps of the KG creation. These characteristics, such as the size of data or format type, affect choosing the proper tool in each step.
- **User request**: The matcher should suggest a set of tools to users according to their requests.
- **Previous choices of the user**: E.g., if the user tends to use a specific tool for a particular dataset, the matcher should consider the previous choices. 

## Features
We used [OntoSoft-VFF](http://ontosoft-earthcube.github.io/ontosoft/ontosoft%20ontology/v1.0.1/doc/) to describe these four parameters (For the full list, please check the OntoSoft-VFF page):
